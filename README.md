#### Description

Do you ever have that cringe in your tummy before running **rm -rf**?  Worse yet, the face palm after running it?

I wrote a bash script named **rmrf** that allows me to safely delete directories.  If anybody's interested, I'll make it accessible.  Been using it for years w/o a mistake. BTW - I use rmrf while in the command line  and typically use **rm -rf** in script files.  [Reference](https://twitter.com/lex_sheehan/status/1168634686001897482)
